<h1>about</h1><h2 id='about_us'><a href='about_us.html'>about us</a></h2><p><b>Hundred Rabbits</b> is an artist collective that document low-tech solutions with the hope of building a more resilient future. We live and work aboard a  sailboat named <a href='pino.html' class='local'>Pino</a> in remote parts of the world to learn more about how technology degrades beyond the shores of the western world.</p>

<p>Our sailboat is a Yamaha33, a 1982 masthead sloop fiberglass sailboat. <b>Pino</b> is the name of an android in the anime <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergo_Proxy' target='_blank'>Ergo Proxy</a>. <b>Hundred Rabbits</b> is inspired from the name of the sailboat in that same show, the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centzon_T%C5%8Dt%C5%8Dchtin' target='_blank'>Centzon Totochtin</a>.</p>

<p>Fully-geared, stocked with provisions for 4 months (food & water) Pino weighs 7484,274 kg (16,500 lbs), or 8.25 tons. Out of the factory, the boat was 4,400 kg (9,700.00 lbs), or 4.85 tons (about half that weight is ballast).</p>

<p>Pino moves from ship to shore with <a href='teapot.html' class='local'>Teapot</a>. We carry two <a href='bikes.html' class='local'>bikes</a> aboard to explore the new places we visit, and to fetch groceries.</p>

<p>We build software following these rules:</p>

<h3 id='offline_first'>offline first</h3>
<p>We build and design our software to work offline first. They will never need online resources to function properly, they will always be bundled with enough documentation to be repaired without our help. Our software will never be released behind any form of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management' class='external' target='_blank'>Digital Rights Management</a>.</p>

<h3 id='past_proofing'>past proofing</h3>
<p>We build simple tools to tackle <a href='https://brandur.org/small-sharp-tools' class='external' target='_blank'>specific tasks</a>. We release builds and documentation to support a wide range of platforms, from native applications to terminal tools. We target 20 years old hardware as to encourage recyclism and discourage the consumption of fashionable electronics.</p>

<h3 id='freedom'>freedom</h3>
<p>We release free and open-source programs so that they can be studied, inspected and repaired by anyone, <a href='mission.html'>anywhere</a>. We create software and documentation for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution' class='external' target='_blank'>BSDs</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux' class='external' target='_blank'>GNU/Linux</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs' class='external' target='_blank'>Plan 9</a>.</p>

<div class='notice'>Because of the decentralized nature of our work, this has to be spelled out quite clearly: Preparing for impending apocalyptic events should mean <b>collective action and structural reform</b>, not individualism and isolation.</div>

<p>We are committed to fighting normative violence, fascism, colonialism, and racial supremacy in all of its forms. To undermine the capitalist structure and its abusive scripts about human worth in relation to work, productivity, and ownership. To subvert oppressive gender norms and put in question the binary. To actively unlearn biased and colonial thinking.</p>

<p>We are aggressively opposed to racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, nationalism, ethnocentrism, religious fundamentalism, and oppressive and coercive power structures of all kinds. <a href='https://blood-and-dust.com/politics/' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<h2 id='mission'><a href='mission.html'>mission</a></h2><img src='../media/content/about/mission.jpg' loading='lazy' />

<p>We founded <b>Hundred Rabbits</b> with the goal of building a platform that could enable us to dedicate our time to the creation of small, playful, free, open-source software, while considering the impact of our works on the environment, and optimizing toward living more sustainably. We've adapted our software and projects around the limitations of our vessel instead of increasing its limits. We learned to appreciate these limits and think that they make our work better.</p>

<p>The benefits of many modern technologies today are illusory, and undermine people's self-sufficiency, freedom, and dignity. Ivan Illich proposed the concept of "convivial tools" that honor human agency and creativity. Convivial tools are not proprietary, in the style of many software today, but open-ended, flexible instruments that serve the needs and interests of ordinary individuals and communities.</p>

<p>We want our work to be an equal blend of aesthetics, playfulness, and practicality. A well-written and functional software is necessary, but an attention to beauty and play enriches a project, creates a sense of culture, and more importantly it motivates us to pursue deeper, more meaningful lives in a world designed to dispossess and distract us.</p>

<img src='../media/content/knowledge/humanscale.jpg' loading='lazy' />

<p>We aim to keep our software small, portable and build from first principles to keep them participatory.</p>

<p>Work that is done to obfuscate the inner workings of a program, or make it difficult to compile, turns someone into a mere user. If it's too hard for people to teach themselves, we may never get to hear their ideas. Ideas from a plurality of people make art, software and knowledge transmission more accessible and resilient. Diversity is important in nearly all aspects, whether it's with computers, or with life itself. A polyculture of tools and systems distributes the surface of attack and creates resilience. Viruses can attack a single crop, or a single computer architecture. The more services, or resources are centralized, the more power is concentrated into fewer hands and more easily taken over.</p>

<img src='../media/content/knowledge/monoculture.jpg' loading='lazy' />

<p>The abundance of digital storage and processing power has caused an explosion in wastefulness, which shows in things like ridiculous hardware requirements for computing even the most trivial tasks. There is a new movement in tech inspired from permaculture, called <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/permacomputing.html' target='_blank'>permacomputing</a> that aims at only using computing when it has a strengthening effect on ecosystems.</p>

<p>Instead of planned obsolescence, permacomputing practices planned longevity, reuse and repair of existing technology and approaches waste as a resource. Designing for Disassembly ensures that all elements of a product can be disassembled for repair and for end of life. This allows for and encourages repairs, with the result that a product's life cycle is prolonged; and it allows for a product to be taken apart at the end of its life so that each component can be reclaimed.</p>

<p>As Hundred Rabbits, we have decided to focus on documenting, and archiving, means of reusing and repairing older devices and programs. All of our tools are designed to work offline first, operate with little-power on older devices and operating systems. Operating this way, we can keep creating content while off-grid, and when our power and connectivity is limited.</p>

<h2 id='story'><a href='story.html'>story</a></h2><p>Back in 2016, when first operating on a sailboat, we experienced frequent failures with both software & hardware, largely due to our small <a href='energy.html' class='local'>energy</a> storage and lack of reliable connectivity. The solution was to create tools that would be better suited to the limits of our new situation. The objective was to replace the bloated subscription software that we were using to do creative work, such as Photoshop, Xcode and Ableton. We were somewhat familiar with web technologies, so we decided to build our programs on this new up and coming framework called Electron.</p>

<p>While solving some of our issues, Electron was rapidly increasing in size and hunger, so despite it being open-source soon joined the rest of the software that we did away with. Our focus shifted toward reducing our energy use, and to ensure reliability we began removing dependencies.</p>

<p>To transition toward our new goals, we developed offline web versions as temporary stand-ins while researching ways to build more resilient software. We eventually ported our tools to C, but while we had achieved ideal energy usage, portability was still an issue for graphical applications, so we kept looking. We learned <a href='6502_assembly.html' class='local'>6502 Assembly</a>, seeing players run our games as NES roms on all these different platforms gave us an idea.</p>

<p>In 2021, we began designing a small virtual machine with a <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/devlog' target='_blank'>focus on implementability</a>; meaning that moving forward, the applications themselves would no longer need to be ported. Instead, to make any one program available on a new platform, the emulator would be the only code needing to be modified, which is explicitly designed to be easily implemented.</p>

<p>This is where we are now. <a href='uxn.html' class='local'>Uxn</a> might solve our cross-platform issues, while being quite light and energy efficient. We hope that one day the Uxn versions of our software replace the desktop and web versions &mdash; But, we'll have to see about that [16.05.21].</p>

<q>Let's try to go slow, and fix things.</q>

<h2 id='why_a_boat'><a href='why_a_boat.html'>why a boat</a></h2><img src='../media/content/about/pino_03.png' loading='lazy' />

<p>From 2012 to 2014, we lived in Japan. Rek was working in an animation studio, and Devine, in a software company. On weekends and evenings, we worked on our first two games: <a href='hiversaires.html' class='local'>Hiversaires</a> & <a href='oquonie.html' class='local'>Oquonie</a>. Originally from Québec, we were traveling back and forth between Canada and Japan often. We wanted to exit the wasteful loop of acquiring the necessities of life each time our lives were uprooted.</p>

<p>We had heard of people living on sailboats but neither of us had even stepped foot on one, nevertheless, we soon found ourselves watching the videos of <a href='https://youtu.be/Aub3MkFxpHE'>David Wellsford</a>, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkaH_UUH0Ek'>Teresa Carey</a> and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkYfFeySHGN4DPrOc9So7PA'>Nike Steiger</a>, and became obsessed with the idea. Lack of experience aside, we thought that traveling was a good catalyst for learning new languages, for developing an interest in foreign cultures and ultimately for building empathy, curiosity, and creativity.</p>

<p>In January 2016, we left the cold of Montréal and moved west to British Columbia, where we purchased <a href='pino.html' class='local'>Pino</a>. Our curiosity soon led us to make our first trip out to sea, which <i>escalated</i> into a circumnavigation of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Our life at sea changed how we work, and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW32yUEymvU&feature=youtu.be' target='_blank' class='external'>how we think</a>. We've always made art, and always will, but now we are working on ways to keep doing that sustainably, which translates to making lean and open software that are backward-compatible.</p>

<q>A boat, for all its complexity, is in fact a version of simplicity, but of a satisfyingly complex kind.</q>

<p>In 2016, we moved aboard Pino with two MacbookPro 2012s. One of them died in Mexico in late 2016 (see <a href='tools_ecosystem.html' class='local'>tools ecosystem</a> for details). A friend gave us a used MacbookPro 17", but it was too power-hungy for the boat, and it later died in 2020 during our passage from Japan to Canada across the <a href='north_pacific_ocean.html' class='local'>North Pacific Ocean</a>(a giant jar of umeshu exploded over it).</p>

<p>Most of our computers are secondhand, donated to the studio between 2017 and now. We'd like to thank the following people: <a href='https://twitter.com/thisismyclone' target='_blank'>Josh Auget</a> for the x250Thinkpad, <a href='https://twitter.com/johneternal' target='_blank'>John Eternal</a> for the MacbookPro 13" 2010, <a href='https://nnnnnnnn.co/' target='_blank'>Brian Crabtree</a> for the Pinebook, and <a href='https://lloydwilliams.co/' target='_blank'>Lloyd Williams</a> for the MacbookAir 2013 11".</p>

</ul>

<p><b>Current issues:</b></p>

<p>In August 2023, the Pinebook(Manjaro) developed a weird keyboard error, making it impossible to input a password to log in, and then it stopped booting. We'll try to fix it later when in port. The MacbookPro 2012 also stopped booting, not sure why. We'll test it later when we have access to AC (may be battery related).</p>
<p><b>2023.11.18.</b> The Macbook Pro 2010 has a faulty bottom ram slot. The good news is that both ram modules still work, but we can now only use one(we can upgrade the working one for larger capacity).</p>

<p><b>Wiki</b>. In April 2021, this website was converted into a wiki. This type of website is a kind of archive and mirror of everything that we have done, and that we have learnt. It's a living document that outlines where we've been, and a tool that advises where we could go.</p>

<p>Rek is the steward of this wiki, and authors most of its write-ups and articles(unless stated otherwise). Devine proofreads Rek's writing, and appends to the documentation of our projects regularly. You can download a copy of the entire website content and sources as a <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/100r.co/archive/refs/heads/main.zip' target='_blank'>.zip</a>.</p>

<p>In all that is shared on the many pages populating this wiki, we reserve the right to be wrong, and to change our minds. We are always learning, and deepening our view and understanding of any one thing.</p>

<p><b>Videos</b>. Between 2016 and 2020, we filmed our travels. We filmed regularly, but kept many experiences to ourselves, wishing to be present during worthwhile moments instead of hiding behind a lens. At the end of each month, we would watch our footage and write a summary of that month's events. We planned the monthly <a href='videos.html' class='local'>videos</a> ahead, and we would gather footage based on what we needed. While one was busy recording the narration, the other would write music. We had our respective tasks when it came time to edit, but both of us took part in the filming.</p>

<p>In rough weather, we prioritize our own safety above all, and so we rarely had footage of rough seas.</p>
