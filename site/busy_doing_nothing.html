<p>The book is printed on demand. Lulu.com works with printers all over the world, so that most copies are produced locally and travel relatively short distances. It can take 3 to 5 work days to print the book. Since the books are printed, packaged, and shipped by humans, mistakes may happen. If your book arrives in less-than-perfect condition, <a href='https://help.lulu.com/en/support/solutions/articles/64000255314-providing-digital-defect-images' target='_blank'>contact Lulu.com</a> with images of shipping damage or printing errors, and they will send you another copy.</p>

<p>In 2020, we completed our circumnavigation of the Pacific ocean. The last passage from <a href='japan.html' class='local'>Japan</a> (Shimoda) to Canada (Victoria) took 51 days, and it was the hardest thing we've ever done. We decided to keep a physical logbook of daily happenings onboard.</p>

<img src='../media/content/projects/busydoingnothing_02.png' loading='lazy' alt='A closeup of the handwritten ship log featuring a rough drawing of a character sitting under a cloud of rain with the words: this is fine' title='A page from the physical logbook we kept on the trip'/>

<p>Upon our arrival, we transcribed the handwritten pages, so we could publish them online.</p>

<p>In fall 2020, we decided to expand on it, and to release it as a digital book. We revised most of the text, added new art and expanded on specific logs.</p>

<p>The book was written in Markdown and formatted to PDF and EPUB using <a href='https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/' target="_blank">Tectonic</a> and CSS via <a href='https://pandoc.org/' target="_blank">Pandoc</a>. The first edition of Busy Doing Nothing was released on February 17th 2021. The book is <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/busydoingnothing' target="_">open source</a>, but buying it is a way of supporting our work. The <a href='north_pacific_logbook.html' class='local'>North Pacific Logbook</a> is still online, but does not include new content.</p>

<p>In December 2021, we finally formatted and released a paperback version of the book. We settled on using Lulu.com, since they provide a very good print-on-demand service and that we can't physically keep many copies of physical books on the boat due to space (and moisture) constraints.</p>
