<h1>victoria to sitka logbook</h1>
<h2 id='transcript'>transcript</h2>
<p>On the passage from <b><a href='victoria.html' class='local'>Victoria</a></b> to <b><a href='sitka.html' class='local'>Sitka</a></b> we traveled 1,800 NM, the journey lasting from May 1st to August 11th 2024. Rek kept a logbook of our travels, to help us remember the conditions we encountered, our thoughts at the time, etc. Sailing near shore, we think, is more difficult than sailing offshore, there are more obstacles to deal with, like traffic, reefs, currents, and land effects on wind.</p>
<p>Our aim was to get near 58°N, the highest we sailed on this trip was 57°N. We wanted to explore Southeast Alaska and the north coast of British Columbia, to experience anchoring in deeper waters, and to see if we could enjoy sailing in colder, rainier weather.</p>

    <td><b><a href='victoria.html' class='local'>Victoria</a> to Sidney</b><hr><img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_photo_01.jpg'alt="view from the deck of a sailboat of a lighthouse with snowcapped mountains in the background" loading='lazy'></a>I awoke to an awful sound, an alarm ringing at 0540. Devine had been waking up at 0600 every second day all year to go to the gym, and so was used to this, but I could not find my feet. The morning was rude, I couldn't persuade my body to leave the bed to face it — it had taken us so long to build up this much warmth! I knew that current waits for no one, and so with eyes still closed, my legs crawled out of the blankets, my body inevitably followed, ragdolling out of bed and into the cold.<br>We got dressed, to preserve what little warmth we had left, then made sure that everything aboard was secured for our sail to Sidney. We're always forgetful when we haven't sailed in a while. In the winter, the boat is still, so still that it becomes part of the land. <a href='pino.html' class='local'>Pino</a> sways at the dock in heavy winds, but nothing threatens to fall over, the motion is never violent. Now, each item must go back to its assigned spot, lashed down.<br>There is light outside at this hour, it helps, but waking before the birds is not right. As soon as we moved outside, Peter, our dock neighbor and good friend, was there to greet us. Peter, like myself, doesn't share Devine's early hour waking habit, but he knew we were leaving, and made an effort to be there to say goodbye. Even at this early morning hour, Peter looked as dapper as ever, Peter, who goes to the gym in corduroy pants and button down shirts. We hug, he helps us push off.</td>

    <td>Pino glided away from the dock on calm waters, propelled by Calcifer II. Our departure awoke another neighbor, Gunther, he was outside, and he too waved us off, "where are you going again?" he asked. "Alaska!" we whisper-shouted back as we drifted past — it was early, we didn't want to make more noise than necessary. The little ephemeral floating community we'd found was precious, like birds returning to land to nest every year, we all gather in the fall, and come spring, everyone flies away. Some birds return to the nest, others don't, drawn by the allure of distant lands.<br> A light breeze greeted us at the mouth of the outer Victoria Harbour, we hoisted Pino's wings inside the calm of the breakwater. When out in the Juan de Fuca Strait, the body of water that we must cross to get to Sidney, the wind was not strong enough to push us by itself. Calcifer II continued to provide help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>  
    <td>Last winter, we built our own <a href='gimballed_stove.html' class='local'>gimballed stove</a>, we tried it for the first time underway. I toasted bread in our heavy cast iron pan, then coated one side of the crunched-up exterior with peanut butter. While we ate our breakfast, I boiled water to thin the moka pot coffee — doing this fools us into thinking there is more coffee to drink. I passed the grinder to Devine outside who was steering and holding the tiller with one leg. We had modified our tiller head for this trip, it was now low enough that we could steer like this, freeing our hands for other tasks. We bought this wooden tiller at a scrapyard in Sonoma(California) in 2016, when sailing down the west coast of the United States. The head, which binds the tiller to the rudder stock, forced it at an angle that was abnormally high for steering, but the tiller itself was perfect. We rectified the design this year, but only because a crack had formed in the head which forced us to put together a makeshift replacement, consisting of an aluminum pipe, several heavy bolts and bungees. When the water in the kettle was hot, I switched it for the moka pot and completed our breakfast routine. The boat wasn't heeling enough for this to be a good first test for our stove, but the unit performed well.</td>

    <td>Victoria is on the south end of a peninsula to the southeast of Vancouver Island, Sidney is on the northeastern end of this same peninsula, 25 NM away. When we turned around the south end of the peninsula, the wind left us, as it tends to do in this area. The wind only ever bends around the corner when Juan de Fuca is in a bad mood. The calm lured out several small fishing boats. We laughed, seeing the number of gulls at their heels. Each boat had its own little gull fan club. Some gulls were resting on the cabin tops, the rest were in the water, paddling around, waiting for scraps or for space to free up on the boat. We wondered if the people on those boats liked the gulls. Were they friends? Did they give them names? Or were they a terrible nuisance?</td>

    <td><b>Sidney to Montague</b><hr><img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_photo_02.jpg' alt="view from the deck of a sailboat, at sail, with a ferry crossing the bow of the vessel" loading='lazy'></a>The alarm rang at 0600, we snoozed until 0640, then left at 0800 to catch the current north to our next anchorage. Bing, bang, boom. After pushing off the dock, we pulled onto another to fill 4x20 L bins with diesel — our main fuel tank only holds 62 L, keeping annexes aboard is necessary for long coastal trips. We hoped the wind would be a frequent companion on our trek north.</td>
</tr>
<tr>  
    <td>The wind was blowing out of the northeast, but we only felt it once past Portland Island. It was coming out of where we needed to go, but as strange as it sounds to those unacquainted with the physics of sailing, a sailboat can work with this. We tightened the sheets and sailed into the wind, tacking as required. Devine read through a thick book documenting Southeast Alaska anchorages, while I, at the tiller, counted cormorants in the water. We saw a group of 30 near Portland Island, with a few gulls amongst them. The gulls were outnumbered, out of place, surrounded by cormorant heads — both were easy to distinguish from afar, because cormorants sink, while gulls float.<img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_02.jpg' alt="a gull afloat on the water surrounded by cormorants, only their heads showing" loading='lazy'>We played dodge-the-ferries, while tacking northward, until the breeze became too weak to sail with. Calcifer II carried us the rest of the way to Montague Harbour. We arrived at 1300. Tacking had added 3 extra nautical miles to our trip. Sailing into the wind is not the quickest way forward, we can't be in a hurry, but timing matters when sailing in waters governed by strong currents. The current reverses many times per day, when it turns against us, progress is slow, and depending on the strength of the current it can stop our vessel outright. If the wind isn't with us, with a current running, progress is a beautiful dream. Our motor can carry us through <i>some</i> current, but it feels like throwing money into the ocean. In these waters, seeing sailboats motor into the wind, constrained by a short tidal exchange, is common.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>We arrived in Montague Harbour, a large anchorage on Galiano Island that can host hundreds of boats, dropping our anchor in 11 m(35 ft). The bay hosts several local boats on moorings, but was otherwise empty. Despite there being large areas free of anchored boats, a large motor boat came into the anchorage, 20 minutes after we had arrived, and dropped their anchor very near ours. Pino is a shiny lure, drawing the attention of bigger fish.<img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_01.jpg' alt="a large motor vessel, drawn as a big cute blog of a creature, is throwing its anchor down close to pino, grinning all the while. Pino is not pleased." loading='lazy'>Inside the cabin, we picked up a few disobedient items that had rolled out of their berths. Some items had found the floor, "this isn't your room," I said, remembering the classic line said by Tom Hanks to a dog in Turner and Hooch — sometimes I fear that too many of my words are borrowed from films.<br>We prepared basmati rice with sauteed sweet potatoes, tofu, and greens, seasoned with soy sauce and mirin, with a side of miso soup.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>That night, we continued reading The Martian by Andy Weir. In the book, Mark Whatney must be self-sufficient, he must ration his food to survive. With our upcoming trip, we don't have to ration, our time away from others won't span 4 years, but we do need to be cautious with both food and water. At sea, Pino must be an island.</td>

    <td><b>Montague</b><hr><br>The wind was too light to sail, so we waited in Montague for an extra day. Avi sent us a message, asking if we'd like to go see the Recycling Center's new plastic crusher and press. We rowed Teapot to shore and met Avi at the dinghy dock, he gave us a ride to the Recycling Center.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The new machines transformed plastic waste into new materials, which locals could use to produce art, for construction, or to make replacement parts at home. Same type plastics were gathered — polypropylene, polystyrene, etc. The shredder reduced the plastic into smaller pieces, and a separate machine, a heated hydraulic press, softened and merged the bits into a solid sheet. The size of the sheet depended on the amount of shredded plastic, and the sheet thickness(adjustable with the press). Mixing different colored plastics resulted in a gorgeous mandala daubed with bright and glaring patterns. Ading a single shredded bottle of yellow mustard created amazing contrast. The sheet of plastic ressembled a painting, born of plastic waste.<br>Previously, Galiano Island was exporting all of its plastic waste to the Vancouver mainland, a lot of it now stays on the island, given a second, and hopefully lasting purpose.<br>The recycling center was across from a building that accepts second hand goods, all from residents of Galiano. The center separates all recyclables so they are better processed — just like in Japan. The rest of British Columbia doesn't discern between different kinds of plastics, it also doesn't recycle glass... which is... insane.</td>

    <td><b>Montague to Secretary Islands</b><img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_photo_04.jpg' alt="a photo of a small opening between two islands, with somekind of industrial building way in the background, emitting smoke"  loading='lazy'></a>0830 departure from <a href='galiano.html' class='local'>Galiano</a> Island, with the goal of stopping either at a bight between the Secretary Islands, or at Clam Bay, a short 10 NM sail away. We needed an anchorage that offered protection from both the SE and NW — a difficult find in these waters, given the fact that most bays have either a SE or NW orientation. Montague fits that description, but it was too far south, we wanted to be near Porlier Pass to exit at slack current come morning. The Gulf Islands are surrounded by natural barriers, rapids that prudent sailors ought to take at slack tide, during the calm between the reversal of the current. All of the rapids open onto Georgia Strait, a large body of water that separates Vancouver Island from the mainland coast.<br>The Secretary Islands anchorage was on the way to Clam Bay, we had never been there, but we would go by to check it out, to see if it was suitable for an overnight stay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>We had 5-10 kn on our bow the entire way, but it lessened as we neared our destination. The small bight between the Secretary Islands was open to the north, and we suspected that northwest winds could creep in through Porlier Pass to disturb it, but we decided to chance it.<br>We set our anchor in 6 m (20 ft) of water, in mud. The stronger gusts were curling around the corner, entering the anchorage. The winds later rose to 15-20 kn, but would lessen before dying entirely. It was supposed to turn to the southeast overnight, and to build up come Sunday morning into a strong enough breeze to carry us across the strait. It was likely that we would have endured these same wind conditions in Clam Bay. Clam Bay, a bay tucked between two islands, is full of debris, old crab pots, disused aquaculture gear, it is not our favorite spot. The unnamed bight in the Secretary Islands was a welcome change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>At 1400, the forecast was upgraded to a strong wind warning, with 20-30 kn blowing in the strait — not a fun surprise. The anchorage became more rolly, with the boat yawing with the coming waves. We both felt sea sick. Like before, only the strong gusts penetrated our little bight, but the waves were sneaking around the corner, invading our space. Devine took a nap, working on the computer in these conditions was too difficult. I wanted to nap too, to rid myself of a headache, but I preferred to keep watch. <img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_04.jpg' alt="pino the sailboat at anchor, not enjoying the wind waves" loading='lazy'></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Later, the forecast changed yet again, down to 15-25 kn. The motion at anchor became tolerable, cooking dinner without fear of feeling sea sick would be possible. I cooked some sticky brown rice with a topping of sweet and sour chickpeas with crushed peanuts on top. The wind was howling in the strait, but it wasn't felt as strongly here. The wind left entirely at 1700, allowing us to sleep well. We are always grateful when the wind goes to sleep too.</td>

    <td><b>Secretary Islands to <a href='smuggler_cove.html' class='local'>Smuggler Cove</a></b><hr><br>We awoke to an even quieter quiet. A lonely log drifted past, a bald eagle sat atop a bare tree top, a dog barked, the echo distorted the bark of the dog, making it appear like it belonged to a larger, more ferorious animal.<br>We left our unnamed nook at 0830, motoring towards Porlier Pass to catch it at its quietest. Porlier Pass can run fast at peak current, but like all rapids, when timed right, the waters are smooth. Today, the waters were undisturbed. We passed a log supporting 12 black-headed gulls, we named them: the black-headed gull syndicate. This log was <i>the</i> place to be, this is where shady decisions in the black-headed gull world happened.<img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_05.jpg' / loading='lazy'>A small fishing boat idled in the pass in the shallows, we glided past them, hoping to find a rippled sea in the strait. Ripples were indicative of wind. The forecast had been unreliable, what was supposed to be 10-15 kn out of the southeast, turned into wind that was supposed to die entirely at 1000, not long after our exit from Porlier Pass. Wind was forecast in the north part of Georgia Strait, so we thought we'd go out and find it. We spotted a band of darker water on the horizon, there <i>was</i> wind out there, but we had to push further away from the shore to reach it. We met with the rippled band of water, hoping that it would stay rippled, it did, with many more bands ahead.</td>

    <td>Our plan was to skirt along the length of Galiano Island, if the wind did not manifest we would duck into Gabriola(another island, further north). The wind stayed, so we pushed on.<br>10-15 kn winds out of the southeast carried us all the way across. The wind did lessen at times, but it always increased again to fill our sails. The day started grey, and stayed grey. Our new rain jackets saw their first rain today. Our former foulweather gear would get wet and stay wet, making any sail in the rain uncomfortable, while our new vinyl bibs and jackets kept us dry. Although, keeping our hands dry and warm at the same time was a problem.</td>

    <td>It was difficult to see the Vancouver mainland with this rain. In the absense of a visual reference, we had to follow our compass. We took turns steering Pino. When we spend long days on the water we have to give the other time to rest, to warm up. Most Alaska-bound sailors favor boats with enclosed cockpits, but Pino's cockpit is always exposed to the weather. The rain, the sun, and the wind always find us. Both of us were dry today, but it was cold, we hadn't layered on enough clothes.</td>

<tr>
    <td>When we arrived at the entrance to Smuggler's Cove it was 1600, both of us were spent, our defenses eroded by the prolonged exposure to the rain and cold. In such conditions, our bodies have to work extra harder to keep us warm, burning more energy. "My tank is low." Just as I'd said this, the rain increased, bringing the morale onboard to a newfound low. We dropped the hook in the middle basin, not bothering to stern-tie to shore.<br>Devine fired up the woodstove while I secured gear in the cockpit and on deck, determined not to have to go back out there once I tasted the warmth of the cabin. We ate a hearty rice noodle soup, it warmed our insides, while the woodstove took care of our outer shells. Our plan for tomorrow was to go to the grocery store in Pender Harbour. In our haste to leave Victoria, we forgot to stock up on a few key ingredients, like olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. The grocery store there, we knew, had excellent baguettes in stock.<br>A singlehanded sailor came into the anchorage at 1900, he decided to stern-tie, even if there was room, even if it was raining buckets.<img src="../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_06.jpg" alt="a drawing of smugglers cove, showing some boats at anchor, as well as islets and shoals" loading="lazy"></td>

    <td><b>Smuggler's Cove to Pender Harbour</b><hr><br>The wind kept us awake last night. Southeast winds funnel through Smuggler's Cove. Our swing radius was very limited in this bay, when the anchor rode was taut, we were 18 m (60 ft) away from the shore. We assumed a southeast wind would point us toward the outer basin. Swinging that close to shore doesn't ever stop being worrisome. We were awake from 0100 to 0400. After 0400, the wind lessened, our anchor watch was over, we fell asleep.</td>

    <td>We woke up at 0700. We've experienced big weather while anchored in this bay before, but whenever a detail changes, like anchoring somewhere new in the same bay, it is difficult to have complete trust.

We prepared whole wheat pancakes for breakfast, while firing up the woodstove.</td>

The sun came out during our transit, warming our bodies, a reminder that the world could be warm, that it could have color in it. Some clouds drew shapes on Texada Island, while others, heavy with water, threatened to burst. We spied a large cloud with a skirt of rain, south of us, the wind was helping it along, it too had Pender Harbour in sight. We hoped to arrive before it reached us.</td>

We hope to find one in Port McNeill, a city near the top of Vancouver Island. We would use the axe to split our own kindling for the woodstove, wood sold in stores is usually not sized for our little 23x23 cm firebox. Mornings are still very cold aboard Pino, we run the woodstove to stay comfortable.</td>

We inched out of the Harbour by motor, and sailed as soon as we cleared the outermost island and begun a seemingly infinite succession of tacking, with one coast fading away while the other came into focus. On each tack, our eyes found a landmark to aim for across the channel. Every lighthouse, old cannery, cliff face or clear-cut area on a mountain, acted a a marker and a proof of our progress.<br>We had to tack 6 times to line up with the entrance to Ballet Bay, our planned anchorage of the day.</td>

    <td>Once we arrived into Ballet Bay, we saw that the catamaran had claimed the shallows, but we found a spot nearby in 13 m (45 ft, 16 m / 55 ft at HW). The northwest wind found its way into the bay, but there were no waves at least.<br>We prepared sandwiches with a baguette we picked up in Pender Harbour. I was glad to have waited to arrive to eat, some meals are unpleasant to eat underway. When the wind and the waves are up, I feel like I have to finish the meal in a hurry, I don't get to enjoy it.

In 13 m (45 ft) of water, all of the chain rode is out (we have 30 m / 100 ft of chain aboard), with a good length of rope rode hanging in the deeps. Pino does not have a windlass aboard, we haul everything up by hand, or by using a chain hook and leading a line back to a cockpit winch. The chain stopper at the bow locks the chain, permitting us to adjust the chain hook safely. We can't use the same technique for the rope rode, though. Up until now, we did it by hand, but that won't be possible in depths greater than 18 m (60 ft), which we'll likely encounter up north. Our plan was to tie a prusik knot around the rope rode to haul it in (read more about it in <a href='no_windlass.html' class='local'>no windlass</a>).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>This is not the fastest, or easiest method of hauling an anchor rode, but it works. Today, the wind was light, the water not too deep, we hoped it would continue to work well in more difficult conditions. Winches provide excellent mechanical advantage. A determined sailor could lift an anchor by way of a 4:1 pulley system alone, a technique <a href="https://roperescuetraining.com/index.php" target="_blank">rescuers</a> use, but winches are present on most boats our size. Motor boats too could benefit from having a winch onboard, especially in the event of a windlass failure, or to pull in a stern line in heavy winds. We've seen boats failing to secure their stern lines with wind on the beam because they lacked the strength to pull the line in by hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>After hauling all of the rode back on deck, we motored out of Ballet Bay to a calm Malaspina Strait. The forecast called for 5-15 kn out of the northwest. Sometimes this means 5, other times 15, but it is usually zero. I spied a dark blue band on the water ahead. "Either that's wind, or a tide line," I said, grabbing the binoculars, "Wind! Lots of it!" We raised Pino's wings, entered the blue band, and sailed, sailed, sailed! Then, shortly after, we reefed, reefed, reefed, because the wind was stronger than 15 kn(we cannot offer precise readings, because our wind meter died a long time ago). As we reefed the main, we accidentally heaved-to, which sent a few loose items rolling in the cabin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>We zigzagged up Malaspina Strait. The wind lessened as we neared Sturt Bay on the northeast end of Texada Island. While moorage on this coast keeps increasing, the dock fees for the modest facilities at the Texada Boating Club continue to be reasonable, but we decided to try anchoring in the bay north of the docks for the first time instead. We later learned that the bottom was fouled with old logging gear. Texada Island's industry, consisting of both logging and mining, has mostly disappeared, but scars remain. Many bays on this coast are fouled with old machinery, we often see rusty cables and gear on land when hiking, posing as roots, half-buried in the soil and ferns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>We had Japanese curry for dinner, using up two whole potatoes that had begun to sprout. These days, we move everytime there is wind, even if it's weak. In the summer, a forecast of 5-15 kn will often mean no wind, but if the same numbers are forecast in the spring, the higher number is often more accurate. So far, we have sailed almost everyday. This was very different from the kind of sailing we'd done in these waters these past 4 years. We usually enjoy staying in the same anchorage for days, or weeks at a time. We will have to slow down once we arrive near open waters, stronger weather may not allow us to sail everyday — I am getting ahead of myself, eyes on tomorrow, Rek, eyes on tomorrow... well, eyes on tonight! I look forward to continuing to read The Martian. Mark Whatney is sprouting potatoes, just like us!</td>

The jackets each had 2 stoppers on the bottom, but we never used them. The only thing that these stoppers were good for was for getting caught in the cabin table when walking inside. Our table has an extension — bound to the main part of the table by a piano hinge — that we fold down when underway. The stopper on my jacket liked to get caught in the hinge between the two halves.

We planned to cross the rapids on the 12th of May, until then we had time to waste. Why the 12th? Because the turn to ebb was at a reasonable hour on a neap tide. Neap tides are the lowest tides of the lunar month, occurring in the second and fourth quarters of the moon. At this point in the lunar cycle, the tide's range is at its minimum, making it an ideal time to traverse through fast-flowing rapids. A small tide reduces the speed of the current.</td>

The fender squeaked and shifted uncomfortably as I tied the other end of the trip line onto it, as if to say, "you have <i>got</i> to be kidding!" The fender recalled the time we used it and 2 others of its kin to buoy our anchor chain while in French Polynesia. The 3 fenders were submerged, hovering in the depths, preventing the chain from getting caught in coral on the ocean floor.

I had replaced both the plug and the seal earlier this year, the seal was too worn to keep, but the plug was fine.<br>We ate our hummus, doing our best to ignore the weather outside.

We knew we couldn't carry enough wood to keep the stove running constantly, but it was useful to warm our space on cold mornings and late evenings. We filled Pino's aft locker with wood, storing the rest in bags in the starboard side cockpit locker.<br>We finished splitting the wood just as the rain started.

This was true for Cape Caution, the waters shoaled to 9-15 m (30-50 ft) near the cape. To make matters worse, Cape Caution was preceeded by another danger: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slingsby_Channel" target="_blank">Nakwakto Rapids</a> — one of the fastest and most turbulent rapids in the world. When the channel is at peak ebb with an opposing wind, the contact between the two will generate very large waves in the north part of the strait.

I lowered the chain back down again to allow for the jellyfish to return to the water.<br>Once the anchor was up, we hoisted the mainsail, putting in 2 reefs.

    <td>One reason I was hesitant to go to Higgins Passage yesterday, was because I was afraid that leaving the anchorage in big southerly winds would be too dangerous. The exit, as I described earlier, was full of reefs, and it was not very well protected from waves. I was concerned about the size of the waves that we would find out there...<br>I wasn't wrong about the big waves at the exit. Our proximity to shore caused them to swell up to monstrous heights. The reefs did what they do best, continuing to lie in the way — such discourteous reefs. Getting away from the anchorage was dicey, one large wave threw us hard sideways, but we recovered quickly. We thought we had perfected the art of stowing items in big seas, but there was always one or two things that came rolling out to prove us wrong. "Hey, hey! Look at me!" they'd say. "No! Go back to your spot!" They never listen, and proceed to tumbling around the cabin floor, waiting for us to move them.<br>We motor-sailed until we were a bit further from shore, if we only sailed we ran the risk of drifting too far towards the shore. We shut Calcifer II off as soon as we were clear of dangers.</td>

    <td>The sea conditions improved once we arrived into Laredo Channel. Devine had been steering into the worse of the waves, and  went inside to rest while I took over. Devine got the waves, but I got the rain. Yes, the rain and came, it fell heavy, reminding me of what it was like sailing through squalls while in the South Pacific ocean. The rain clouds brought stronger winds along with them. Luckily, I was prepared for both rain and cold! The rain jackets and bibs we got were PVC, they kept us dry. When our former foulweather jackets got wet, they stayed wet, but our new rainproof gear would dry very fast, so they didn't bring too much humidity inside the cabin. The only issue with those jackets is that they weren't warm, so today, we wore our other foulweather jackets under the waterproof coats — perfection. Going to the head, having to peel off all of those extra layers was an ordeal, but staying warm was important.<img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_14.jpg'alt="rek and all of the layers they wear when sailing in cold wet weather" loading='lazy'><img src='../media/content/blog/logbook_vs_15.jpg'alt="devine and all of the layers they wear when sailing in cold wet weather" loading='lazy'></td>

Any glove we own gets instantly wet as soon as we start to handle ropes, we always have to adjust the jib or main sheet, we can't avoid it. The gloves imbibed all of the water that had been weighing down our lines, a transaction that we would gladly do away with.</td>

The rain had stopped for a while, but came back as we began to motor down Racey Inlet, the wetness stayed with us for the entire way, except now, we had it in the face rather then in the back. Downwind, the rain hit our backs and wasn't bothersome, but now, it was soaking Devine's front. "UGH!" I ugh'ed back in agreement.<br>The rain fell very hard at times. I was partially hidden behind our mini dodger, navigating from there, my spot was a haven in comparison to Devine's exposed location. I offered to take turns.<br>To make matters worse, there as a bit of current against us in the inlet, slowing our progress, prolonging our time in the rain. The time to our destination felt like it stayed at 52 minutes for 3 hours, in reality, it took us a bit over an hour to arrive, but it felt like more in those conditions. When we create waypoints on our chartplotter, we can see the time left to our destination based on our current speed. It is sometimes reassuring to see the time we have left, but today, it was driving us mad.</td>

    <td>We pushed deeper and deeper, the inlet narrowed and narrowed, until we reached Bone Anchorage. Yes! Finally! There were a few rocks to dodge, but it was nothing when compared to what we had to deal with in Higgins Passage. We found the source of the opposing current ahead, a stream of water, we could hear the sound of water rushing. We passed a crab trap float, and could see the pull the water had on it, this is what we were up against. Even at anchor, the current kept our rope rode taut.</td>

We arrived to Bone Anchorage earlier than we thought, the wind helped to push us north fast, but the rain was an unwelcomed companion.

While the Salish Sea experiences water shortages in the high summer, this place must never experience this kind of thirst.</td>

We bought some minutes for our SAT phone for such times, but we weren't going to get a signal out here, in a place tucked between tall mountains. I tried anyway, but noticed that the app that we use to visualize GRIB files was uninstalled on our little ipad — how did this happen? We didn't do this. We learned that Apple thinks its doing us a favor by uninstalling apps — without our consent — that we haven't used in a while, to save on storage space. I really do not like technology making decisions for me. We will only have internet access in Prince Rupert to re-install this app. Fuck you Apple, for removing apps without asking...

The squall clouds were enormous, they spewed out tropical-style amounts of rain while accelerating the wind in the area. One particular squall scared me. The wind whistled in the rigging as it approached us from the stern. Lacking a wind meter, we cannot know the exact wind speed, but we could tell it was strong by listening. The following waves were impressive, pushing at our rear, the sky was dark too, making the scene all the more ominous.<br>I had an anxiety attack, maybe it was fatigue, but more likely it was the fear of big waves. Ever since one threw me overboard I felt nervous when a high wave approached our boat. If it sounded big but wasn't, it still had the power to frighten me. I wasn't sure if this fear would persist, we hadn't seen proper ocean swells since the summer of 2020. I might not have reacted this way if I had been tethered to the boat, I wasn't. The tether was what kept me attached the boat that last time. I should have had it on me already. Anyhow, Devine, kind and sweet and infinitely supportive, rushed out to steer as the squall passed. It gave me time to compose myself, the fear was still there, but the shock subsided. Devine endured another squall later for me. Solid gold Devine.</td>

It took us a while to find a place suitable for lowering the mainsail, the wind was coming at us from too many different directions. The narrowest part of the inlet had no wind, so we doused it there.<br>My hands were frozen when we arrived near the anchorage, they were red and sensitive. Reaching under the folded mainsail to secure it with a sail tie hurt like hell. I slipped my anchoring gloves on, gloves that were torn, salty, cold, wet and reeking of various sea things. I really need to replace these gloves. I was fine using them in the Salish Sea, but it was struggle in colder waters, as was heaving chain hand-over-hand. Holding metal that had been soaking in cool waters all night wasn't pleasant.</td>

    <td>Speaking of cold hands, arriving in Patterson Inlet, I let down the anchor & chain in 12 m (42 ft HW) of water. Here, the tides were 6 m (20 ft), something we had to consider when choosing a spot. Like all places on this coast, Patterson Inlet was quiet, green and surrounded by mountains and wildlife. We always heard the sound of rushing water, from a fast-flowing river, or waterfall nearby.<br>But as always, the cold and wetness had worn us out. In Quebec, we say "avoir les deux yeux dans l'même trou," to say that we are very tired, it translates to "having two eyes in the same hole." That was the best way to describe how we felt when we arrived.</td>
