<p>Stings from marine life can range from painful, to life-threatening.</p>

<p>If stung by a jellyfish:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Flush the injured area with hot water, or vinegar for at least 30 seconds</b>, if neither are available, mix baking soda and water into a paste and apply it to the area for 20 minutes.</li>
		<li><b>Remove any pieces of the animal</b>, while protecting your hands, </li>
		<li><b>Immerse the affected area</b> in water as hot as the person can tolerate for at least 20 minutes, or until the person feels less pain</li>
	</ul>

<p>Seek medical attention if there is an infection, or if the person has trouble breathing. <b>Always flush with vinegar FIRST</b>, before removing any part of the animal, the tentacles can continue to fire even after they're detached so you must neutralize the poison before touching them or they could inject more poison into the person.</p>
