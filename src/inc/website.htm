<p><b>Wiki</b>. In April 2021, this website was converted into a wiki. This type of website is a kind of archive and mirror of everything that we have done, and that we have learnt. It's a living document that outlines where we've been, and a tool that advises where we could go. We append to the documentation of our projects regularly. You can download a copy of the entire website content and sources as a <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/100r.co/archive/refs/heads/main.zip' target='_blank'>.zip</a>.</p>

<p>In all that is shared on the many pages populating this wiki, we reserve the right to be wrong, and to change our minds. We are always learning, and deepening our view and understanding of any one thing.</p>

<p>This wiki is statically generated from a small C89 program, the sources are available <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/100r.co/' target='_blank'>here</a>, if you find a typo, a broken link or have a code specific question, feel free to open an <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/100r.co/issues/new' target='_blank'>issue</a>.</p>

<p>This website has <b>no</b> tracking or analytics.</p>
