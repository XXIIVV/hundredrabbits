<h2>A Shining Place Built Upon The Sand</h2>

<p>I dreamt I was in a library. But the library didn't look like a library at
all. You know how in dreams you feel like you know someone to be a specific
person without them necessarily having their appearance. This is how I knew
this was a library.</p>

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_02.png'/>

<p>Not that it mattered to most people in it, as it was more of a backdrop to
their lives, in fact, most people didn't pick up a single book in their
lifetime. These lives are spent within the walls of large octagonal rooms. In
each room, there are 4 hallways connecting to other rooms. Restrooms and
bedrooms, and other facilities are found in the gaps. A perpetual day radiates
from the translucent glassy floor. At the center of some octagons grows a fruit
tree.</p>

<p> In the silence of the library, people communicate by signing to each other.
Every conceivable meaning is transmitted quietly that way. Each sign
corresponds to either one of 32 word, or one of 16 numbers. The children learn
to count with their fingers. The difference is that they count in base-16, or
hexadecimal. They say there are 4 fingers in a hand and a thumb. Each hand can
count to 16, 32 if you use the thumb Both hands can count to 256.</p>

<p>In each octagon, 4 walls each hold 8 shelves. On the shelves, instead of
Borges' books of 410 pages, each of 40 high, and line some 80 characters
wide. The books in this library are perfectly square, each page is 16 lines long,
each line 16 letters wide. Each book contains exactly 256 pages.</p>

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_06.png'/>

<p>The pages are made of a material that feels like bark, on it grows a kind of
moss, which can be marked with a reed and erased by rubbing your thumb over the
marks, like how you can draw on some carpets, and erase by passing your hand
the other way and align the fibers.</p>

<h3>Alphabet</h3>
<p>In my dream, the language used these 32 letters. You do not need to learn
these characters, I won't be teaching you a new language. I will only show you
some of its attributes</p>
<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_08.png'/>

<h3>Numbers</h3>
<p>It also has 16 numbers.</p>
<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_09.png'/>

<p>The alphabet has the properties of some other alphabets where letters are
equal to numbers, and vice versa.</p>

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_10.png'/>

<p>Unlike the latin alphabet, in which most organizations of letters are
meaningless.</p>

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_11.png'/>

<p>Or, sometimes intelligible, but equally meaningless.</p>

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_12.png'/>

<p>Every combination of letters of this alphabet means something.</p>

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_13.png'/>

<p>But that also means that the cost of a single letter mistake throws the
		story into an entirely different direction.</p>

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_14.png'/>

<p>Whereas, in natural languages, a wrong letter, or a shuffled word might still
preserve some of its meaning, making natural language more robust. </p>

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_15.png'/>

<p>The language's grammar differ a bit from natural languages, in that the same
line might be read multiple times. It's common to read a sentence that says to
read that same line once again. It's also common to be told to skip everything
until the end, only to come back. The text carries the reader to different
places in the book. For example, here it says to read this 5 five times:</p>

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_16.png'/>

<p>They are call "lazy", the readers who will come across a word like <b>infinity</b>,
And instead of reading it infinitely, understand the word to mean infinity, and
read over it.</p>

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_17.png'/>

<p>In these seemingly infinite recursions, many spend their entire life going in
circle, expecting to someday reach the book's end, even tho it might not end.
And so, you find these people going round and round in their book, hoping to
get to the end, there is no clear process of elimination that will tell you if
a book ends or not. Some books change ever so slightly that people still
believe that they might terminate, but they can never be sure.</p>

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_18.png'/>

<p>For example, this snippet of text above is also known as the tak() function
Let me show you what this does in a familiar language:</p>

<img style='max-width:350px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_19.png'/>

<p>Which you can understand how this sentence has consumed a lot reading time.
Confounding the reader to recurse near infinitely back over the same passage.</p>

<p>Here is a fragment of a book which can be read in both directions, in which
every letter is read(not jumped over) and just happens to reveal the letters "T
E N E T" in ASCII values.</p>

<p>Notice how this program begins and and with the same things This is called a
palindromic program. Some suggested that reading the book forward and backward
reduces the search for meaninful books by half. Others have said that, instead,
this doubles the work of searching for meaningful books as one is now fearing
to come across The Book, only to now fearing to having read it the wrong way
around.</p>

<p>Some inhabitants of the library believed that the astronomical number of
permutations of these 65536 letters books were too few, that the books
don't have enough pages, that the alphabet has too few letters.</p>

<p>"Get with the times!" We need bigger books!"</p>

<p>We haven't even begun to explore this one and you want a bigger one? But, even my dream, I had in my mind the idea that other libraries must exist
where the symbols on the pages are different.</p>

<p>And others believed in the opposite, that our usage of so many characters is
frivolous. They suggest that the alphabet could be encoded entirely in two
characters, a dot and a dash, capable of encoding all possible meaning. So
why write this..</p>

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_21.png'/>

<p>.. When you can write this!</p>

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_22.png'/>

<p>And so, in the library, dialects have emerged where people use restricted sets of
letters.</p>

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_24.png'/>

<p>In fact, in my dream, after wandering the halls for what seemed a long time, I
found an ancient stairway that lead me down closer to the sun. As I was going
down, my fingers traced the walls, and I noticed the brickwork began to change,
it appeared that the library was a rather new construction, built on top of a
much older foundation. There, I met an inhabitant of the sublevels of the
library. This person, whom for some reason evoked in me, a sense of loss, told
me that the only letters anyone needs is these 4. I was incredulous at first,
it took me a while to understand what this person meant, so let me try to
explain what I was told:</p>

<!--

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_25.png'/>

<p>I will use decimal numbers from now on so I can communicate this to you
properly. To understand what I'm about to tell you, it's important to
understand that: <b>the prime factoring of a number is to break it down into
indivisible parts</b>.</p>

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_26.png'/>

<p>When you multiply a number by a fraction, what you really are doing is
decrement the prime factors in the denumerator, and incrementing those in the
numerator. For example: we remove one amount of 2 and add one amount of 3, in
3/2. We remove one amount of 3 and add one amount of 2, in 2/3.</p>

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_27.png'/>

<p>So we can think of any number as a bag, containing items of different
numerical values, or prime values. Primes are like the DNA of numbers.</p>

<p>The way these books are read, is like this: First, each book begins with a bag, or an accumulator number. Followed by a series of fractions.</p>

<p>Keeping that number in mind, we walk through each fraction on the page
if the modulo of our accumulator with the denominator is zero, we update our accumulator
by the product of the multiplication of the accumulator and the fraction and start over at the
first fraction, otherwise we try the next fraction.</p>

<img style='max-width:400px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_29.png'/>

<p>For example: (18 % 2) = 0, it means that the bag is divisible by it, that our
bag contains that item, we multiply 18 by 5, update the accumulator and start
over until it fails to match, then move onto the second fraction, and stop upon
reaching the end.</p>

<p>This is how I came to learn that each book in each library, can be encoded in
nothing but fractions and multiplications. This is page of a book adds two
numbers together stored in r2 and r3: We itterate like this, first emptying r2
into r5 Then r3 into r5. We have added 1+2=3</p>

<p>If we look at complete implementation of this program in pseudocode:</p>

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_30.png'/>

<p>But this is all too complicated, let's look at it another way. Basically what
we have on the pages, as a list of changes. We can give names to registers and
do away with fractions altogether: r2 = apple, r3 = orange, ..</p>

<img style='max-width:400px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_31.png'/>

<p>This one indicates to take an apple(r2) out of a bag, and put in two
orange(r3):</p>

<img style='max-width:400px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_32.png'/>

<p> If we look at the page from before, we can think of it as these changes:</p>

<img style='max-width:400px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_33.png'/>

<p> I'm using names for registers, but I could just as easily use shapes,
colors, tastes, smells..</p>

<img style='max-width:400px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_34.png'/>

<p> Here's what boolean logic looks like: If my bag contains the items x and y, I
take them out, and put in a true item -- otherwise a false one.</p>

<img style='max-width:400px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_35.png'/>

<p>If we want to compare the value of two registers</p>

<img style='max-width:400px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_36.png'/>

<p>To get a fibionnaci number:</p>

<img style='max-width:400px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_37.png'/>

<p>These books are reversible too, as long as numerators and denomerators are all
unique. Books can be read backward, from the end to the start, and recover the
original state. I think: This is fantastic!</p>

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_38.png'/>

<p> The mind reels, beholding all these possibilities, the implications of a
computation system so fundamental that it can be explained in 10 seconds,
transcends language, seems to be weeved in the fabric of the universe itself.
Why isn't this more known, we should rewrite our library! I'm dying to see the
library halls that hold these books. I would love to see all the different
libraries! So, I ask: Are there halls without books? "yes, there are halls
where the people destroyed them" What?! why, would anyone do that. It's
inconcievable, it's painful enough to think of those who don't ever pick a book
from the shelf. If it was up to me everyone should be forced to learn how to
read, a book in every hands! I say.</p>

<img style='max-width:350px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_39.png'/>

<p> This person stops me. "Why did do you think, the first person took one of
these books off of the shelf?" I don't know, maybe they were looking to better
understand the universe, to learn about history, or just to waste some time
reading some fiction. I answer "It was to so they could more assuredly kill
someone at a distance." Then I wake up. Dreams are silly like that. I fell
asleep in front oh my terminal waiting for the ARM architecture manual to
open.</p>

<img style='max-width:700px' src='../media/content/blog/shin_40.png'/>

<p>And, it's still loading..</p>
