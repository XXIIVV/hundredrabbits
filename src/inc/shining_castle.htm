<p>I dreamt I was in a library. But the library didn't look like a library at
all. You know how in dreams you feel like you know someone to be a specific
person without them necessarily having their appearance. This is how I knew
this was a library.</p>

<p>Not that it mattered to most people in it, as it was more of a backdrop to
their lives, in fact, most people didn't pick up a single book in their
lifetime. These lives are spent within the walls of large octagonal rooms.</p>


<p>In each room, there are 4 hallways connecting to other rooms.
Restrooms and bedrooms, and other facilities are found in the gaps
A perpetual day radiates from the translucent glassy floor.
At the center of some octagons grows a fruit tree.</p>

<p> In the silence of the library, people communicate by signing to each other.
Every conceivable meaning is transmitted quietly that way. Each sign
corresponds to either one of 32 word, or one of 16 numbers.</p>

<p>In my dream, the children learn to count with their fingers, like 0, 1, 2, 3,
Only, they count in base-16, or hexadecimal. They say there are 4 fingers in a
hand and a thumb. Each hand can count to 16, 32 if you use the thumb Both hands
can count to 256.</p>

<!--

<p>In each octagon, 4 walls each hold 8 shelves. On the shelves: Instead of
Borges' books of 410 pages, each of 40 high, and line some 80 characters
wide.</p>

<p>The books in this library are perfectly square, each page is 16 lines long,
each line 16 letters wide. Each book contains exactly 256 pages.</p>

<p>The pages are made of a material that feels like bark, on it grows moss, which
can be marked with a reed And erased by rubbing your thumb over the marks, like
how you can draw on some carpets, and erase by passing your hand the other way
and align the fibers.</p>

<p>In my dream, the language of the library used these 32 letters. You do not need
to learn these characters, I won't be teaching you a new language. I will only
show you some of its attributes</p>

<p>It also has 16 numbers.</p>

<p>The alphabet has the properties of some other alphabets where letters are
equal to numbers, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Unlike the latin alphabet, in which most organizations of letters are
meaningless.</p>

<p>Or, sometimes intelligible, but equally meaningless.</p>

<p>Every combination of letters of this alphabet means something.</p>

<p>But that also means that the cost of a single letter mistake throws the
		story into an entirely different direction.</p>

<p>Whereas, in natural languages, a wrong letter, or a shuffled word might still
preserve some of its meaning, making natural language more robust. </p>

<p> The language's grammar differ a bit from natural languages, in that the same
line might be read multiple times. It's common to read a sentence that says to
read that same line once again. It's also common to be told to skip everything
until the end, only to come back. The text carries the reader to different
places in the book. "For example, here it says to read this 5 five times."</p>

<p>They are call "lazy", the readers who will come across a word like "infinity",
And instead of reading it infinitely, understand the word to mean infinity, and
read over it. So the concept of infinity, can be used as noun.</p>

<p>In these infinite recursions, many spend their entire life going in circle,
expecting to someday reach the book's end, even tho it might not end. And so,
you find these people going round and round in their book, hoping to get to the
end, there is no clear process of elimination that will tell you if a book ends
or not. Some books change ever so slightly that people still believe that they
might terminate, but they can never be sure.</p>

<p>For example, this snippet of text: also known as the tak() function
Let me show you what this does in a familiar language</p>

<p>Which you can understand how this sentence has consumed a lot reading time.
Confounding the reader to recurse near infinitely back over the same passage.</p>

<p>Here is a fragment of a book which can be read in both directions, in which
every letter is read(not jumped over) and just happens to reveal the letters "T
E N E T" in ASCII values. Notice how this program begins and and with the same
things This is called a palindromic program. Some suggested that reading the
book forward and backward reduces the search for meaninful books by half.
Others have said that, instead, this doubles the work of searching for
meaningful books as one is now fearing to come across The Book, only to now
fearing to having read it the wrong way around.</p>

<p>Some people of the library, believed that the astronomical number of
permutations of these 65536 letters books were too few. other that, the books
don't have enough pages, or that the alphabet has too few letters People were
saying "Get with the times!" We need bigger books! And I thought, but we
haven't even begun to explore this one and you want a bigger one? But, even my
dream, I had in my mind the idea that other libraries must exist where the
symbols on the pages are different.</p>

<p>Others believe the opposite, that our usage of so many characters is
frivolous. They suggest that the alphabet could be encoded entirely in two
characters, a dot and a dash, capable of encoding all possible meaning. - So
why write this..</p>

<p>.. When you can write this!</p>

<p>In the library, dialects have emerged where people use restricted sets of
letters.</p>

<p>In fact, in my dream, after wandering the halls for what seemed a long time, I
found an ancient stairway that lead me down closer to the sun. As I was going
down, my finges traced the walls, and I noticed the brickwork began to change,
it appeared that the library was a rather new construction, built on top of a
much older foundation. There, I met an inhabitant of the sublevels of the
library This person, whom for some reason evoked in me, a sense of loss, told
me that the only letters anyone needs is these 4. I was incredulous at first,
it took me a while to understand what this person meant, so let me try to
explain what I was told.</p>

<p>I will use decimal numbers from now on so I can communicate this to you
properly The prime factoring of a number is to break it down into indivisible
parts.</p>

<p>When you multiply a number by a fraction, what you really are doing is
decrement the prime factors in the denumerator, and incrementing those in the
numerator.</p>

<p>We remove one amount of 2 and add one amount of 3, in 3/2. We remove one
amount of 3 and add one amount of 2, in 2/3.</p>


<p>So we can think of any number as a bag, containing items of different
numerical values, or prime values: Primes are like the DNA of numbers.</p>

<p>The way these books are read, is like this:
First, it begins with a bag, or an accumulator number.
Followed by a series of fractions.
Keeping that number in mind, we walk through each fraction on the page
If the modulo of our accumulator with the denominator is zero,
			(18 % 2) = 0, it means that the bag is divisible by it,
			.. but really what it means is that this bag contains that item.
			.. we multiply 18 by 5, update the accumulator and start over.
			.. otherwise we try the next fraction.
So as this person explained to me, 
			with this system, we can encode every book found in every libraries.</p>

<p>This is pseudo book adds two numbers together stored in r2 and r3: We itterate
like this, first emptying r2 into r5 Then r3 into r5 We have added 1+2=3</p>

<p>If we look at complete implementation of this program in pseudocode:</p>

<p> It's all too complicated, let's look at it another way. Basically what we
have on the pages, as a list of changes. We can give names to registers: r2 =
apple, r3 = orange</p>

<p> This one indicates to take an apple(r2) out of a bag And a put in two
orange(r3)</p>

<p> If we look at the page from before, we can think of it as these changes:</p>

<p> I'm using names for registers, but I could just as easily use shapes,
colors, tastes, smells..</p>

<p> Here's what boolean logic looks like: If my bag contains the items x and y, I
take them out, and put in a true item -- otherwise a false one.</p>

<p>If we want to compare the value of two registers</p>

<p>To get a fibionnaci number:</p>

<p>These books are reversible too, as long as denomerators are all unique. Books
can be read backward, from the end to the start, and recover the original
state. I think: This is fantastic!</p>

<p> The mind reels, beholding all these possibilities, the implications of a
computation system so fundamental that it can be explained in 10 seconds,
transcends language, seems to be weeved in the fabric of the universe itself.
Why isn't this more known, we should rewrite our library! I'm dying to see the
library halls that hold these books. I would love to see all the different
libraries! So, I ask: Are there halls without books? "yes, there are halls
where the people destroyed them" What?! why, would anyone do that. It's
inconcievable, it's painful enough to think of those who don't ever pick a book
from the shelf. If it was up to me everyone should be forced to learn how to
read, a book in every hands! I say.</p>

<p> This person stops me. "Why did do you think, the first person took one of
these books off of the shelf?" I don't know, maybe they were looking to better
understand the universe, to learn about history, or just to waste some time
reading some fiction. I answer "It was to so they could more assuredly kill
someone at a distance." Then I wake up. Dreams are silly like that. I fell
asleep in front oh my terminal waiting for the ARM architecture manual to
open.</p>

<p>And, it's still loading..</p>
