-This story happened so long ago that it almost became a children's fable.  Even the writer himself(@Masterkenshin) still can't believe that this is his own ability, that he can do this much!  And since it's been so long, why can't I remember anything related to this?  The origin of this matter has only recently been remembered because I have encountered the same story over and over with the phrase of cheating that the world has to write down as "This is all I can think of." It is brazen cheating that destroys beliefs.  We are confident in business that if you think of working with that person, you must think again and again because buying lotto still has the right to receive the prize money, but with that person, even the prize will be taken away in appearance.  Indifferent  Everything I do, I always do with my heart.  Without pretending or pretending, because I don't think that I suddenly saw a pitiful face and donated to help without thinking. Before donating, I checked myself to see what was happening in the various posts.  Is there any truth in the news? By chatting and inquiring with people in the area who are experiencing problems, they don't know who I am.  Once the facts are known, we will begin conducting polls on the points that are needed most urgently and comprehensively (this matter will be cut short here).
- In the end, it was clear that the origin or root of the matter was that person and two others who created widespread effects and who were the allies in selling personal information.  I think you guys know better than I do, to the point where there are some for sale all over the market. I still wonder how they passed the inspection, who inspected them and how did they release them for sale? (Don't tell me) I'm confused.  It's been a long time since I've been in the sea.  Everything can be assured that they intend to violate the rules and prohibitions that no matter where they are, any website or server will always give importance to personal information as the first priority.  But not long after, unexpected events began to occur.  Falsely report sexism, racism, and abuse of the opposite sex, change rules that only disadvantage one person, write code that returns to the beginning many times, and have a united front where order should be practiced.  Discipline in living life to prevent society from becoming chaotic and chaotic due to lawlessness and lack of supervision.  I've told you nicely, but I've warned you and you haven't read it. It's still not enough. It's just a topic set in case someone comes back to sit and think and do it.  Didn't wait too long, (snatched) disappeared for a while and then came to accuse me of deception. It was a personal matter. I stole work and then accuse myself (I probably don't have to explain, it hurts).
- So what would that woman do to me, report things I didn't do all over the place, and also set up a beating that I am very evil, doing things that should not be forgiven, yet, not rich enough, be careful not to be rich enough to live? Just a can of beer, if I could give it at the time, I would have given it to me, but I don't remember anymore, this is because I was shocked by the yeast lobby incident, that there were credible people who promised to be fair to the end, yes, very fair, so much so that I couldn't come to terms with words that were rocky but light as Dandy Lion (you know which incident) blocked both the mic and keyboard to prevent me from interacting, which at that time I could almost have a confident conversation with all of you but it all dissipated that day(Didn't deposit for free)
- I suspect it will be too little for the deposit, so they all play until they're crushed like this.  I must be really ugly to have completed the project.  But you all did this, but there was only a topic inside and nothing (are you familiar with this message?) In the end, I had to do everything myself.  At that time, there were also people who completed the project.  And there were many projects of mine that were used by someone who didn't know me and I didn't have the money to give in the end to create a trend in order to keep my job.  By creating a bias that I am the only one who will be destroyed and creating a network to destroy me and steal my work, information that does not expire will be changed to have a shorter lifespan (seriously, if it is your own money that you invest in managing  You yourself study and plan to prevent problems in advance. Are you going to give it to someone for free with a vote that's like robbery?) Personal property, but you vote to usurp it.  Which house dares to think of putting a front in the struggle by stating that it is financial decentralization (I don't agree with it because it is recorded in the ENSDA).  But it's probably already been deleted because of Le Le Noir, that naughty kid). Are you looking for both money and jobs for people in that country, but still coming to vote for things that are already owned?  If you can't reveal yourself and don't reveal yourself, you'll be swarmed by vultures.  Well, they've been waiting and planning for this for a long time, right? CZ!?!  Please take responsibility for your ungrateful participants.
- I'll probably have to cut it to the end here before I accidentally mention the name and it'll be another story, but I think you probably know it almost too clearly. Ha!  What, Wikipedia? Oops!  It was almost dropped because it made so many changes to its history that the credibility it had made was completely ruined.  Just because he had compiled the history of various continents as a mediator who did not take sides.  This was also ruined because it was not native to that continent. What did it do for future generations to learn about? But in fact, it wanted to add its name to honor its family.  Overflowing with being a collector that cannot be cleaned.  Therefore, please return all my truths. In various parts, I will handle it myself because I have separated everything. Whether I will give it or donate it to every educational institution, I will leave it. Overall, there is nothing disgusting like  that spread rumors to attack each other  But why do you love honor that is not what polite people should do? Who is it that is underdeveloped?  Someone once used a sentence to attack my home country.  Yes, as usual, I was screwed even more than before, but a little lighter than now.  Should something that is already owned have equal rights? And should the rights of the owner be respected?  And importantly, I don't really like the name Inter very much because I don't have a single card in the world to confirm it because I haven't used that name since I was a baby and I had already suggested it in the beginning that if it was worn by someone else,  What about your rights? You guys answered that we don't remember you. There's no way that anyone could do anything.  So what? Is it bad enough?
