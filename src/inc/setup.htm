<p>We carry many devices onboard, some for everyday tasks, while others are reserved for low-power situations.</p>

<p>In 2016, we moved aboard Pino with two MacbookPro 2012s. One of them died in Mexico in late 2016 (see {tools ecosystem} for details). A friend gave us a used MacbookPro 17", but it was too power-hungy for the boat, and it later died in 2020 during our passage from Japan to Canada across the {North Pacific Ocean}(a giant jar of umeshu exploded over it).</p>

<p>Most of our computers are secondhand, donated to the studio between 2017 and now. We'd like to thank the following people: <a href='https://twitter.com/thisismyclone' target='_blank'>Josh Auget</a> for the x250Thinkpad, <a href='https://twitter.com/johneternal' target='_blank'>John Eternal</a> for the MacbookPro 13" 2010, <a href='https://nnnnnnnn.co/' target='_blank'>Brian Crabtree</a> for the Pinebook, and <a href='https://lloydwilliams.co/' target='_blank'>Lloyd Williams</a> for the MacbookAir 2013 11".</p>

<p><b>Current issues:</b></p>

<p>In August 2023, the Pinebook(Manjaro) developed a weird keyboard error, making it impossible to input a password to log in, and then it stopped booting. We'll try to fix it later when in port. The MacbookPro 2012 also stopped booting, not sure why. We'll test it later when we have access to AC (may be battery related).</p>
<p><b>2023.11.18.</b> The Macbook Pro 2010 has a faulty bottom ram slot. The good news is that both ram modules still work, but we can now only use one(we can upgrade the working one for larger capacity).</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> We are always looking for used laptops, if you can help us on that front, let us know at <b>rabbits ౷ 100r · co</b>.</p>
