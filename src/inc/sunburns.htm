<p>The following precautions will help prevent sunburns:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Limit sun exposure between 1000-1500, if possible.</li>
		<li>Wear light colored clothing that covers the arms, neck and legs.</li>
		<li>Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 and apply it 15-30 minutes before going outdoors. Reapply sunscreen at least every 2 hours, as well as after being in the water and after sweating.</li>
	</ul>

<p>Take a cool shower to relieve pain. Treat mild to moderate sunburns with aloe vera gel. Apply it a few times a day to the sunburnt area.</p>

<p>If you have blisters, leave them. The liquid in the blisters will ensure that the skin heals well, while protecting it from infection. While the sunburn is healing, stay out of the sun, and keep the area covered if outside.</p>
