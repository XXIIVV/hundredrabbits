<p>We enjoy the challenges that come with living on a boat. The {power} limitations and reduced connectivity has re-shaped how we work â€” in a good way. We now create our own software (see {mission}), an open-source ecosystem (see {tools ecosystem}) of creative tools. We document our experience and findings on this website, which doubles as a wiki.</p>

<p>Donations ensure that we can continue to dedicate our time to the creation of small, playful, <a href="https://sr.ht/~rabbits/">open-source software</a> & art projects(books, games etc), with a focus on documenting means of reusing and repairing older devices/programs, as well as archiving traditional seasteading skills.</p>
