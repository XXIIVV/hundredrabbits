<p>We founded Hundred Rabbits with the goal of building a platform that could enable us to dedicate our time to the creation of small, playful, free, <a href="https://sr.ht/~rabbits/">open-source software</a>, while considering the impact of our works on the environment, and optimizing toward living more <a href="../site/computing_and_sustainability.html">sustainably</a>. The project has since expanded to focus on documenting means of reusing and repairing older devices/programs, as well as archiving <a href="../site/rabbit_waves.html">traditional seasteading skills</a>.</p>

<p>We don't run advertisements, this website has no tracking or analytics, nor do we receive money from any company. Our studio and open-source projects are supported mainly by you.</p>
